(optional) Some newer versions of TAS have the field "Certificate Authorities trusted by the Gorouter for back ends and route services"
followed by the field "Certificate Authorities trusted by the Gorouter for client requests". These fields allow the operator greater flexibility
when configuring which CA certs Gorouter trusts for different interactions.

  1. When validating requests using mutual TLS to back ends and route services, the Gorouter trusts multiple certificate
  authorities (CAs) by default. An operator can add additional CAs for the Gorouter to trust for these situations in the
  field "Certificate Authorities trusted by the Gorouter for back ends and route services".
  1. For backwards compatibility with older versions before these properties were split, an operator can configure the
  exact same CA certs to be trusted for clients requests as are trusted for back ends and route services. An operator
  can do this by going to the **Certificate Authorities trusted by the Gorouter for client requests** property and
  selecting **Trust certs provided in "Certificate Authorities trusted by the Gorouter for back ends and route services"**
  1. If an operator wants Gorouter to trust only a particular set of CAs for client requests, then the operator can
  go to the **Certificate Authorities trusted by the Gorouter for client requests** property and select
  **Only trust the following Certificate Authorities**. Then a text box will appear and the operator can enter the CAs.
  When this option is selected Gorouter will only trust the provided CAs for client requests. It will not trust any
  well known CAs provided with the stemcell.
